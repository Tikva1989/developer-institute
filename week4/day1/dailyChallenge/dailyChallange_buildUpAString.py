# Daily Challenge - Build Up A String

# 1. ask the user for string 10 long characters
# 2. Then, print the first and last characters of the given text.

#
# user_str = input("Enter a string")
# # user_str_length = len(user_str)
# #
# if user_str_length < 10:
#     print("string not long enough")
# elif user_str_length > 10:
#         print("string too long")
# else:
#         print(f'the first character is {user_str[0]} the last character is {user_str[(user_str_length-1)]}')

# 3. Construct the string character by character: Print the first character,
# then the second, then the third, until the full string is printed.

# for x in user_str :
#     print(x)

# 4. . Swap some characters around then print the newly jumbled string (hint: look into the shuffle method)
