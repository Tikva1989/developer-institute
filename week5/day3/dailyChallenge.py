#==========================  Daily Challenge - Circle   =============================
'''
The goal is to create a class that represents a simple circle.
A Circle can be defined by either specifying the radius or the diameter.
The user can query the circle for either its radius or diameter.
Other abilities of a Circle instance:
    Compute the circleâ€™s area
    Print the circle and get something nice
    Be able to add two circles together
    Be able to compare two circles to see which is bigger
    Be able to compare two circles and see if there are equal
    Be able to put them in a list and sort them
